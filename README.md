# Oberservability Services
## By: Casey Maloney 


Microservices runtime infrastructure provides an enviroment for running and managing fine-grained distributed application components. There are five technologies to help with that.

    1. Managed container system 
    2. Service mesh 
    3. API gateway layer 
    4. Observability services 
    5. Backing services 

These microservices runtime infrasture supports the runtime life cyctel and enables microservices to communicate in a distributed and short-lived enviroment.

While all 5 components are important, we're just going to talk about ***observability services***. 
_Oberservability services_ suports monitoring, alerting, logging and diagnostics. 
To have microservice observability services it has to support: 

            1. Monitioring the container cluster 
            2. Monitoring services within the cluster 
            3. Visualizing dependencies 
            4. Tracing distributed requests 
            5. Collecting and parsing log data 
            6. Indexing and searching logs 
            7. Debugging and identiying root causes 



It basis is to analyze, measure, and collect data from your system. Early Microservices adapters started to invent their own _observability services_ to fill the gaps in traditional applications. These observability tools are avilable as open-source software as a result of making their own. Small companies provide commercially supported observabilit tools for microservices. And traditional companies like APM have extended their product to support observability services. 


Overall, for a microservice to have observability they need to remember those seven key components. Alot of companies have adapted to support these obserabvaility and have started to even create their own. Observability servies is important to help monitoring, collecting, alerting, and measuring data from their systems.
